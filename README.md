# Faralab  

**Faralab** is an academic open-source web application developed at **Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)**.
It provides an **interactive 3D environment for visualizing and exploring electromagnetism concepts**, allowing students and teachers to create virtual experiments, observe field behaviors and intuitively understand theoretical concepts.

Users can place charges, wires or planes in a 3D virtual space and instantly observe the resulting field distributions, Gaussian surfaces, and equipotential regions.

## Key Features  

- **3D Field Visualization** – Real-time rendering of electric and magnetic fields.  
- **Physics Engine** – Numerical computation of electric fields from charge distributions.  
- **Interactive GUI** – Add, move, and edit physical objects intuitively.  
- **Gaussian & Equipotential Surfaces** – Flux and potential visualization.  
- **Configurable Controls** – Adjustable field scaling and density.  
- **Academic Focus** – Designed for classroom and research use.
